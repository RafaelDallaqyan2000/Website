        <div class="advanced">
            <ol>
                <li><b>1) Read more.</b> Elon read the entire Encyclopædia Britannica as a child and loved to spend time reading books later, when he got older. To succeed in life, you need to constantly continue self-education, broaden your horizons and be fueled by new ideas.</li>
                <li><b>2) Don't waste money on advertising.</b> The high quality of the product itself will lead to increased word of mouth and will lead to success over time.</li>
                <li><b>3) Take risks before it's too late.</b> The best time to be entrepreneurial is when you're young and not yet bound by the sheer amount of commitment that every person has over time. In addition, as you get older, the risks also begin to affect the family and children.</li>
                <li><b>4) Work hard and hard.</b> Elon Musk is known for his strict work ethic. He often works up to 100 hours a week. No one says that you need to do the same, but you can set a pace for yourself, push yourself, remembering that if you slow down, you risk losing your potential.</li>
                <li><b>5) Create, don't complain or criticize.</b> Instead of complaining about the circumstances, Musk tries to find a solution to the problem. So, instead of complaining about traffic jams, the entrepreneur founded The Boring Company, whose goal is to reduce traffic congestion by creating a system of tunnels.</li>
                <li><b>6) Love stakeholders like your own family.</b> Business leaders treat customers and colleagues like family. Musk, for example, regularly expresses gratitude to customers via Twitter. It may seem like a small gesture, but people pay attention to such things.</li>
                <li><b>7) Plan for success, but prepare for failure.</b>You need to make every effort to follow your dream, but at the same time be prepared for the fact that it will not work. It's easier to bounce back from a setback if you already have a fallback plan.</li>
                <li><b>8) Don't follow trends, create them.</b> The most successful companies are focused on creating new innovative solutions. It's better to focus on your uniqueness instead of following others.</li>
                <li><b>9) Look for a positive purpose in the work you do.</b> No matter how small it is, it will help keep you motivated.</li>

        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <div class="divImg"></div>
        <p>Elon Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. When Elon was ten years old, his parents - a Canadian model and a South African electrical engineer - divorced, the children (and Musk had a brother and sister) began to live mainly with their father in Africa. According to the Washington Post, Musk's father was a tough man and treated the children accordingly, for example, forcing them to sit silently for hours and listen to his moralizing. The situation was no better at school. Classmates laughed and mocked the withdrawn nerd Elon, and once beat him so hard that he had to repair a broken nose in the hospital. Musk became more and more withdrawn into himself, his outlet was the computer.</p>

            <h2>Mask family</h2>
            <p>Elon Musk has been married three times (two of them to the same woman). He met his first wife, writer Justine Wilson, while studying in Canada. The couple has five large sons. With his second wife, actress Talulah Riley, the entrepreneur met in London a little later than the start of the divorce proceedings with his ex-wife. They did not have children during their relationship. After divorcing in January 2012, the couple got back together and remarried a year later, only to end their marriage permanently in 2014. Now Elon is in a relationship with 33-year-old Canadian singer Grimes, who recently gave birth to his son.</p>
